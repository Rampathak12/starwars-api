# starwars-api
This repository contains code developed during Week 10, focusing on integrating the Star Wars API (SWAPI) into a frontend application. SWAPI offers extensive data about the Star Wars universe, including characters, films, planets, and starships. In this session, we learned to fetch SWAPI data using JavaScript's fetch API and dynamically display it on a webpage. 

To run this code locally, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and open `index.html` in your browser. Alternatively, utilize a development server like live-server or Python's built-in HTTP server.

Key features include data fetching via fetch API, dynamic rendering with JavaScript and HTML, exploration of various SWAPI categories, and a user-friendly interface.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SWAPI.

Contributions are welcome via pull requests. The project is licensed under the MIT License. Special thanks to SWAPI creators for providing this valuable resource.
